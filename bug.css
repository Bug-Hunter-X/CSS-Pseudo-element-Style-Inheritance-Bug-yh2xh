The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where a pseudo-element is unexpectedly applying styles to an element it shouldn't affect.  The goal is to style only the first list item's marker, but the :before pseudo-element's styles bleed over to subsequent list items.

```css
ul li:first-of-type::before {
  content: "*";
  color: blue;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```
